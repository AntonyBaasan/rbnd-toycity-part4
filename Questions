1) How to add only one commit in the Master branch history?
In my case, when I merge Master into a Feature, the Master 
takes all commit history, I want to add only one commit in the Master.

2) I see very bad code duplication with methods "first" and "last" ?
How to make it DRY?

3) I have "attrs" method which returns list of available attributes.
What is a better way to do it?
