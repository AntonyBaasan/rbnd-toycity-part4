1) I see very bad code duplication with methods "first" and "last"(in Udacidata.rb) ?
How to make it DRY?

2) I have "attrs" method (in Udacidata.rb) which returns list of available attributes.
What is a better way (or other options) to do it?

3) Please give better(or standandartized) solutions to work with CVS?

4) I have lot of duplications, can you give ideas to refactor the code?

5)
